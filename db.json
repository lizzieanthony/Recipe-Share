And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

Working quickly, carefully spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the smoked salmon into the center of each pancake, then spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese on top.

Add vanilla and chocolate mixture (cooled) to whipped cream and pile into meringue shell, swirling top with spatula. Be sure to cool the chocolate mixture before adding to the whipped cream. If it is too warm, the mixture will thin out. If this happens, chill until it is thick enough to put in shell.",
